# 🧠 MRI Brain Tumor Classification with Deep Learning

![screenshot](screenshots/graph.png)

## 📋 Overview

This project is a deep learning application that classifies brain MRI scans to detect the presence of tumors. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical imaging data and make binary predictions (tumor / no tumor).

The goal was to build a robust model capable of learning from image data and making accurate predictions, while gaining practical experience in model training, evaluation, and deployment using Streamlit.
